## Question to claude.ai

i want to write a bash script that takes a CSV file of two columns , first coluum is string 2nd is URLs. I want to generate web page for each of the row of this file taking first row, all lowercase replace space with underscore _, make that the file name with extension .html. Inside of this html file i need to write some coments that makes it actually a redirects to the corresonpding 2nd column URL.

for example,

```
Gao Wang, http://192.168.86.86:8888
```

will generate me an HTML file called gao_wang/index.html that i can host on some website but once i get to this page it redirects me to http://192.168.86.86:8888

I want to write this in shell script and make it a github action so when I change the csv file and push to github, it will detect it and generate the HTML pages and push to github pages. So i can use it t o accomplish page redirects. show me how and write all the codes / github action configurations

Show me the text part of the explanations in Markdown source. The codes as separate code blocks.

## Response from claude.ai

Here's how you can create a bash script and GitHub Action to generate HTML redirect pages from a CSV file and deploy them to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a bash script named `generate_redirects.sh`: ...
2. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file named `.github/workflows/generate-redirects.yml`: ...
3. Place your CSV file named `data.csv` in the root directory of your repository. For example: ...
4. Commit and push the `generate_redirects.sh`, `.github/workflows/generate-redirects.yml`, and `data.csv` files to your GitHub repository.

**Now, whenever you push changes to the [`data.csv` file](https://github.com/statgenetics/statgen-courses/blob/master/.github/workflows/data.csv) in the `main` branch**, the GitHub Action will trigger and execute the following steps:

1. Check out the repository.

2. Run the `generate_redirects.sh` script, passing the `data.csv` file as an argument. The script will:
   - Read each line of the CSV file.
   - Convert the name to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.
   - Create a directory for each name.
   - Generate an HTML redirect file (`index.html`) inside each directory, pointing to the corresponding URL.

3. Deploy the generated HTML files to GitHub Pages using the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` action.

After the GitHub Action completes successfully, you can access the generated redirect pages at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/<name>/`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username, `<repository>` is the name of your repository, and `<name>` is the lowercase name with underscores from the CSV file.

For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe`, your repository is `redirects`, and the CSV file contains `Gao Wang,http://192.168.86.86:8888`, the redirect page will be accessible at `https://johndoe.github.io/redirects/gao_wang/`.

Make sure to replace `<username>` and `<repository>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Additional notes

1. I later asked claude to rewrite it by eliminating `generate_redirects.sh` to put all contents to the yaml file, and put `data.csv` under `.github/workflows/folder`
2. We need to enable gh-pages from Settings of the repo and select source of gh-pages as Github Actions
3. The yaml action file claude generated does not work. However I know that [hugo works](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) so I adopted it to this context eventually getting this file that works:
